# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Purpose of this Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Beks in creating neural networks that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The target variable for our model is: IS_SUCCESSFUL

#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The features of this model are as follows:
'APPLICATION_TYPE',
 'AFFILIATION',
 'CLASSIFICATION',
 'USE_CASE',
 'ORGANIZATION',
 'INCOME_AMT',
 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS'

#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The variables “Name” and “EIN” were removed from our input data as we deemed them not applicable to success of Alphabet Soup’s funding model and analysis.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
